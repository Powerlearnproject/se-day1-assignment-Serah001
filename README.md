#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
reliability-it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance.
efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
security - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968 - NATO Conference)  
   The term software engineering was first coined at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968, addressing the software crisis—the growing difficulty of developing reliable, large-scale software systems. This marked the beginning of structured programming and the push for systematic engineering principles in software development.  

2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1970s - 1980s)  
   With the development of Smalltalk and later C++, the object-oriented programming (OOP)paradigm revo lutionized software development. OOP introduced encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making software more modular, reusable, and maintainable, which was essential for large-scale applications.  

3. The Agile Manifesto and Modern Software Development (2001 - Present)  
   In response to rigid and slow software development processes, the Agile Manifesto was introduced in 2001, emphasizing iterative development, collaboration, and customer feedback. This led to the widespread adoption of Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban, enabling faster and more adaptive software delivery in today's dynamic tech industry.  

Each milestone significantly shaped how software is designed, developed, and maintained, making software engineering more structured, efficient, and user-focused.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
requirement analysis - identify the final user specification.
design - building the framework.
coding - converting software design into tangible code.
testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is flexible and iterative, emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation. Waterfall is sequential and rigid, with distinct phases completed in order
Scenario : Anecdote, A software company was contracted to develop a complex financial system. They used Waterfall for the initial stages, ensuring they had a clear understanding of the requirements. Once development began, they switched to Agile, allowing them to adapt to the client's changing needs.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is responsible for writing the code and developing the entire software product. Aside from coding, a software developer is responsible for sending updates to the project manager and working closely with other team members, including the designer and QA engineer. 
Quality assurance engineer creates tests that identify issues with software before it is deployed.They ensure that quality is maintained at every stage of the development process and that the final product meets the requirements. 
Project Managerroles include  helping the team to design, execute, monitor and finish their work so that the clients will receive higher-quality software products. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application.
Example of IDE ;NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Visual Studio.
VCS it efficiently manages and tracks changes to code over time, facilitating team collaboration and project progress tracking.example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. 
-rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -
-Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures.
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
-Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes.
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
-Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task.
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
-Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users.
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors.
- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.

Explain the
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
importance; improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present eg it clear, specific, and concise.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Create a software program that helps with project management.

Specific, Concise, and Clear Prompt:Develop a web-based project management tool that allows teams to create tasks, assign them to members, set deadlines, and track progress using a Kanban board. The tool should support user authentication, real-time collaboration, and task filtering by status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). Use React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage.  

The second prompt removes ambiguity by specifying the type of software, key features, user interactions, and technology stack.
